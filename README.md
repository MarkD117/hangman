# Hangman
Having a neck is something that most people will have in common. Personally, I like my neck intact. Welcome to the exciting game of Hangman! In this game, your linguistic skills will be put to the ultimate test. Hangman is a challenging experience that combines the thrill of word puzzles with the suspense of saving a life. 

The objective is simple yet thrilling: guess the hidden word by suggesting letters one at a time. But be warned, for every incorrect guess, another piece of the hangman will be assembled. With a limited number of attempts, your mental agility and vocabulary prowess will determine whether the innocent stick figure survives or meets an unfortunate demise. Can you unravel the word and emerge as the hero of this gripping tale? The stage is set, so let the guessing begin!

## UI/UX

### Design Overview
The game was ultimately designed to be interesting to look at as well as intuitive. All of the menus are clearly laid out with enough information to help a first time user to navigate through them with ease. The game provides input validation to assist the user in entering the correct data for the program to function correctly and is also designed to run continuously until the user decides to exit.

### Colour Scheme
[Colorama](https://pypi.org/project/colorama/) was used to apply colour to the text in the terminal. Colours were used to make the program more visually appealing more to give innate meanings to particular sections of the code.

**Colours Used**
- Inputs are displayed in white, this is due to white having the least confict and is easy to read.
- Menu borders are displayed in Cyan.
- Menu headings are displayed in Yellow.
- Errors are displayed in Red.
- Difficulty settings are displayed in Green, Yellow and Red ranging from easy to hard.
- Green and Red are used for win and loss case text.
- The revealed hidden word is displayed in Yellow at the end of the game.
