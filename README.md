# Hangman
Having a neck is something that most people will have in common. Personally, I like my neck intact. Welcome to the exciting game of Hangman! In this game, your linguistic skills will be put to the ultimate test. Hangman is a challenging experience that combines the thrill of word puzzles with the suspense of saving a life. 

The objective is simple yet thrilling: guess the hidden word by suggesting letters one at a time. But be warned, for every incorrect guess, another piece of the hangman will be assembled. With a limited number of attempts, your mental agility and vocabulary prowess will determine whether the innocent stick figure survives or meets an unfortunate demise. Can you unravel the word and emerge as the hero of this gripping tale? The stage is set, so let the guessing begin!
